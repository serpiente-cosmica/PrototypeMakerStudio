## ⚠️ What's Missing (Database Level)

Your **Supabase database** needs to be updated to include the new screens.

### Current Issue:
- Your database has invalid screen IDs: `onboarding_notifications`, `onboarding_analytics`
- These screens don't exist in the code
- Menu Dashboard and My Activities are NOT in your database yet

### Why You See Errors:
```
Screen not implemented
Screen ID: onboarding_notifications
```
This happens because the database is trying to load screens that don't exist in the code.

## 🎯 What You Need To Do

### One-Time Database Update (5 minutes)

Follow the guide in **`DATABASE_FIX_GUIDE.md`** which has 3 simple steps:

1. **Get Your IDs** (Run `get_database_info.sql` in Supabase)
2. **Fix Database** (Run `fix_screens.sql` in Supabase)
3. **Test** (Refresh your browser)

### Quick Version:

```sql
-- Step 1: Get your approach_id
SELECT approach_id FROM app_approaches;

-- Step 2: Open fix_screens.sql, replace YOUR_APPROACH_ID_HERE, and run it

-- Step 3: Refresh browser at:
-- http://localhost:3000/portal/client/YOUR_CLIENT_ID/configure
```
